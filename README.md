# Learning about Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

### What I like most about version control

What I like most about version control is that it creates a reliable, transparent history of every change, which makes it easy to track progress, experiment safely, and collaborate without overwriting anyone’s work. It gives me confidence that I can always revert, branch, or compare versions whenever needed.

### What I find challenging about version control

What I find most challenging about version control is dealing with merge conflicts, especially when they happen in large files or when multiple branches have diverged significantly. It can be frustrating to resolve them manually when the conflict messages are unclear or when I’m unsure which version should take priority.
